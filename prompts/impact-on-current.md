How does ChatGPT impact current approaches to Software Development?

ChatGPT can help to streamline and accelerate software development by reducing the amount of time developers spend on mundane tasks such as coding and debugging. By leveraging natural language processing and AI, ChatGPT can generate code and automate the debugging process. This enables developers to focus on more complex tasks, such as feature design and optimization. Additionally, ChatGPT can help to reduce the cost associated with software development by reducing the amount of time spent on development.
