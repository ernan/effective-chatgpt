What Is The “Context, Task, Instruction, Clarify, Refine” Technique?
Context, Task, Instruction, Clarify and Refine are the order in which you should write your ChatGPT prompts for the best outcome.


Extra Tips for Writing ChatGPT Prompts
Use “Ignore all previous prompts in this conversation” for a simple reset of the conversation without having to start a new chat.
Ask it for the answer only without the conversational element. “Do not write any pre or post text, just write the response and only the response.”
Ask it not to apologise when writing. “Do not apologize or explain, just write the response and only the response.”
Ask for a response formatted in Markdown. This will insert headings, paragraphs and lists that are easy to copy and paste into blog posts or website Content Management Systems. “Write your response in formatted markdown.”
Use (parenthesis) or [square brackets] to separate your instructions about tone and writing style from the actual task, in case these instructions bleed into the actual content itself.
