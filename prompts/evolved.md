ChatGPT has evolved over time in many ways. In its first version (ChatGPT 1.0), it was designed to generate text using a probabilistic language model. Since then, ChatGPT has added support for more complex models, such as transformers and memory networks, which allow for more natural conversations. Additionally, ChatGPT now supports different tasks such as question-answering, summarization, and image captioning. The system is also now more robust and can handle much longer conversations.
